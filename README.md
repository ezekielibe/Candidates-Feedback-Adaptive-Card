Candidate assessment is the process of gathering information about a candidate in order to determine their suitability for a role. This information can be gathered through a variety of methods, including interviews, work samples, and reference checks.

The goal of candidate assessment is to collect enough information to make an informed decision about whether or not a candidate is a good fit for a particular role. This process can be quite time-consuming, but it is essential to making sure that the right people are hired for the right jobs.

There are a few key things to keep in mind when conducting candidate assessments. First, it is important to be as objective as possible. This means avoiding personal biases and preconceptions about candidates. Second, it is important to collect as much information as possible. This means using a variety of assessment methods and talking to multiple references.

Third, it is important to make sure that the assessment process is fair. This means treating all candidates equally and giving them all the same opportunity to showcase their skills and qualifications. Finally, it is important to document everything. This way, there is a record of the assessment process and the decision-making process that can be referenced later which is why this app was created to be used in Microsoft Teams
